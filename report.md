In this assignment I first created a GitHub account. The assingment helped me understand the difference between Git and GitHub as I used the terminal to perform operations on Git and used 
commands configure my Git and initialise a repository. I edited my repositories after commiting which was an interesting feature. The assignment also forced me to learn a bit of
HTML.
