        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My fullname is Muhammad Raees Cassoojee and I am currently 
            twenty years old. I am a third year student studying a
            BSc Computer Science and BSc Applied Math at Wits University.
            I enjoy outdoor activities such as hikes and I enjoy participating
            in multiple sports such as soccer, cricket and padel. I also
            have a passion for animals and enjoy volunteering at institutions
            that take care of animals. My goal is to complete a masters degree
            in Data Science at Wits University.

        <h3>Latest Project</h3>

        <p>
            My latest project involves improving a project I did last year. 
            This is a mobile application that allows users to create a profile,
            locate the nearest available pharmacies and order thier required 
            medication. My improvements require me to create an order history
            that can be replicated from month to month so that users do not
            have to manually repeat orders. I also want to improve the overall
            usability of the application to make it more user-friendly and 
            effective.
